🟢 CI/CD Pipeline for a Simple App
About this Project

I built this project to get hands-on experience with DevOps fundamentals. The idea was simple: automate everything from code changes to deployment so I could see how a real CI/CD pipeline works in practice.

Here, whenever I push code, a workflow automatically:

Builds the app

Runs tests

Creates a Docker image

Deploys it

It’s a small project, but it helped me really understand automation, pipelines, and containerization.

What I Built

A simple app (Node.js / Python / Java)

A GitHub Actions workflow that takes care of building, testing, Dockerizing, and deploying

Tools I Used

GitHub Actions – for automating the workflow

Docker – to containerize the app

GitHub – where everything lives

What I Learned

How to set up a CI/CD pipeline from scratch

How automation can save time and reduce errors

The basics of Docker and container deployment

How GitHub Actions can streamline your workflow

How to Try It

Clone the repo:

git clone <repository-url>


Check out the .github/workflows/ folder to see the CI/CD pipeline

Push a code change and watch the workflow do its magic!
