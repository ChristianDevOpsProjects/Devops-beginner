🟢 CI/CD Pipeline for a Simple App
Project Overview

This project demonstrates a foundational DevOps workflow by implementing a CI/CD pipeline for a simple application. It focuses on automating the build, test, and deployment process, helping beginners understand the principles of continuous integration and continuous delivery.

🚀 Goal

Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying an application whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.

🛠️ What to Build

A simple application in Node.js, Python, or Java

A GitHub Actions pipeline that automates the workflow:

Code push triggers the workflow

Build the application

Run tests

Build a Docker image

Deploy the image to a target environment (e.g., Docker Hub, cloud server)

🧰 Tools & Technologies
